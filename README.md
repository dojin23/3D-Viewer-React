# 3D Terrain Viewer

## Overview

The 3D Terrain Viewer is a web application built with React and Three.js that allows users to upload Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Imagery TIFF files to create a 3D visualization of a terrain. The application reads the TIFF files, processes the elevation and imagery data, and combines them to display a detailed 3D terrain model.

## Features

- **Upload DSM and Imagery Files**: Users can upload DSM and Imagery TIFF files to generate a 3D terrain model.
- **Real-Time 3D Rendering**: Utilizes Three.js for real-time rendering of the 3D terrain model.
- **Interactive Controls**: Includes orbit controls for zooming, panning, and rotating the view.
- **Rotation Feature**: Allows the user to rotate the imagery layer by 90 degrees at a time to align the map correctly.
- **Log Messages**: Displays log messages to provide feedback on the upload and processing status.

## Installation

To run the 3D Terrain Viewer locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd 3D-Viewer-React
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the Application**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4. **Open in Browser**:
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. **Upload Files**:
   - Click on the "Choose File" button under "DSM TIFF" to upload a DSM file.
   - Click on the "Choose File" button under "Imagery TIFF" to upload an imagery file.

2. **Combine and View 3D**:
   - After selecting the files, click on the "Combine and View 3D" button to process the files and display the 3D terrain.

3. **Rotate Imagery**:
   - Use the "Rotate 90Â°" button to rotate the imagery layer by 90 degrees to ensure proper alignment.

4. **View Logs**:
   - The log section at the bottom displays the processing steps and any errors encountered during the process.
